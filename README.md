# Koding Visual
## A repo to share about tips and tricks to create frontend development related project or cool stuffs within the boundaries of HTML, CSS, JS and sometime animation with GSAP or Three.js

This is a dedicated repo for my YouTube channel KodingVisual which share free tutorials and case studies about cool CSS and JS techniques to spice up the web. I try to create simple stuffs first but this "simple" doesn't mean a basic one page or one section UI Layout. It's more like how we can create something unique, interactive, animated elements with as little code as possible using modern CSS and JS approach. Some of the project can be viewed on my [codepen](https://codepen.io/hernandack)
